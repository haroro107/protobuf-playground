## Introduction
This project is created as part of my journey to learn Protocol Buffers. It’s intended to help me grasp the basics of Protobuf, including how to define message schemas, serialize/deserialize data, and integrate Protobuf into applications.

## What is Protobuf?
Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) is a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. It allows for defining data structure once and using it in various languages to communicate between systems, making it efficient for communication in distributed systems.

Learn more from the [official documentation](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers).

## Getting Started
To run the examples in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Install Protobuf Compiler**:
   - Visit the [Protobuf Releases](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases) page and download the latest version for your platform.
   
2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/protobuf-playground.git
   cd protobuf-playground
3. **Build with Makefile**:
   - Ensure you have make installed. If not, install it using your package manager.
   - Run the following command to build the project:
   ```bash
   make build
4. **Run with Makefile**:
   - After building, run the project using:
   ```bash
   make run

## Learning Goals
The primary objectives of this repository are:
- **Understanding Protobuf Basics**: Learn how to define Protobuf message schemas and understand the core concepts of Protocol Buffers.
- **Serialization and Deserialization**: Practice encoding and decoding data using Protobuf to efficiently serialize structured data.
- **Integration**: Explore how Protobuf can be integrated into different programming languages and applications.

## Notes
- Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username or the appropriate repository URL.
- Check the `Makefile` for any custom targets or dependencies specific to your project.
